# Assignment 1
## Running the code
The simulator requires a Python 2.7 installation in order to run the `run.py` file; the file containing the code for the robot behaviour is `assignment.py`.

## Goal of the assignment
The goal for this assignment is to make a robot move continuously around a specific arena: the robot cannot touch any wall, representeed by the golden token, while has to grab all the silver token met along the path and put them backward. Once it has completed this action it has to move on and continues as before.
